With this tool you can extract all the translatable strings present in a file (or files) that belongs to a WordPress theme or plugin.

Usage: Just drop your files here => https://mdifelice.github.io/po-extractor/

Tested on Chrome.

To-Do List:

- Add support for several languages at the same time.
- Avoid ignore current translations (now it does it, but only if they were generated by this program).
- Make automatic translation optional.
- Add support for the following functions: translate(), _n(), _x(), _ex(), _nx(), esc_attr_x(), esc_html_x(), _n_noop(), _nx_noop() and translate_nooped_plural().
- Find bugs and fix them :).
